			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>
				This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the
				most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft). The
				language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first appeared in
				that company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in all subsequent
				browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from Microsoft starting with
				Internet Explorer 3.0. The development of this Standard started in
				November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma Standard was adopted by
				the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.
			</p>

			<p>
				That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under the
				fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard ISO/IEC
				16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998 approved
				the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with ISO/IEC
				16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are editorial in
				nature.
			</p>

			<p>
				The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular
				expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch
				exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for numeric
				output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming
				internationalisation facilities and future language growth. The third
				edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General
				Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June
				2002.
